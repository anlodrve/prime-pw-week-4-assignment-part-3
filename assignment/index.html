    <ul> I'm wondering why sometimes you have to declare a variable and other times you can just start using a variable without declaring it separately, like item in this part of the assignment. I'm sure it has to do with syntax, that's just how you write it, but I want to learn more about the different situations when this works and when it doesn't.  </ul>
